# Contain your Excitement [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/iVisionATL/docker-contain.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/iVisionATL/docker-contain) 

This is a presentation about Docker containers, originally written for the [Gwinnett Georgia Microsoft User Group (GGMUG)](https://www.meetup.com/Gwinnett-Microsoft-Users-Group/events/237645287/). 

## Abstract 

Docker is the de facto standard for container technology, a lightweight mechanism for packaging applications and runtimes in a small, portable unit that contains all of the dependencies necessary to run a component. With Docker, developers can achieve new levels of productivity with a streamlined process to pull down new containers, execute them, and even compose complex environments that can run with a single command. In this talk that assumes no prior knowledge of Docker, Jeremy discusses what containers are, how they are run and managed, then demonstrates with hands-on examples both building and running single containers with Docker and managing a full environment (database, APIs, and websites) leveraging Docker Compose.
